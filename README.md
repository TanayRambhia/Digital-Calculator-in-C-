In this project I have made a Digital Calcultor where it has different functions like:
1. Arithmetic Operations i.e Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and Modulus.
2. Trignometric Operations i.e sin,cos,tan,etc.
3. Inverse Operations i.e Square Root and Power funtion.
4. Interest i.e Simple Interest and Compound Interest
